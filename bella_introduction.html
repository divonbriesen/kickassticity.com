        My name is Isabella, I am 23 years old and I am currently a senior at
        UNCC pursuing a degree in art history with a minor in Japanese studies.
        I transferred to UNCC last year from Mitchell Community College. My
        biggest goal in life is to fluently know the Japanese language.
        Additionally, what I would like to do in the future one day especially
        knowing this language is to live in Japan and work there in the field of
        art history as a curator, translation at a video game or computer
        company (i.e. Windows), and possibly teach as an English teacher down
        there. I enjoy exercising, reading, and shopping.

          <span class="section-title">Personal background:</span> I was born in
          Erie, Pennsylvania and moved to North Carolina in 2016. When I was
          younger I always enjoyed playing video games and had a fascination
          with the 3D models used in video games and everything else that went
          into the development of them. This is where my interest in computer
          science stemmed from. I also played a lot of sports when I was
          younger, when I was in my 12th grade year I did cross country running.
          My best time was twenty-three minutes.
        </li>

        <li>
          <span class="section-title">Professional background:</span> I don't
          have much of a professional background, at one point in my life I did
          some part-time jobs but other than that what is most important to me
          is my professional career path in the future.
        </li>

        <li>
          <span class="section-title">Academic Background:</span> I graduated
          with a high school diploma and then I wanted to go to Mitchell
          Community College to get an associates in graphic design. This didn't
          work out so that is why I went to UNCC so I could instead get an
          associates degree there with all of my gen eds and then get my major
          in art history and a minor in Japanese studies. I also am going to be
          getting two certificates, one in Japanese translation and the other in
          Japanese business.

              <span class="course-code"
                >ARTH4609 - Art History Senior Seminar</span

              major.

              >: This is a required course in order to fulfill my Japanese minor
              and so I can move on up to the next level of meeting my future
              goal of fluently learning the Japanese language.

            <li>
              <span class="course-code"
                >JAPN3040 - Topics in Japanese Culture</span
              >: I needed to take this course for my Japanese minor. However, I
              was also interested in learning more about what is going to be
              taught in this class so I am more well rounded as a foreigner who
              is going to be traveling and possibly living in Japan one day.
              This course also has benefits to me as someone who will be working
              in the field of art history there since this course teaches about
              Japanese art.

              have been wanting to take computer science courses for a very long
              time because of how much I did want to pursue the endeavor of
              majoring in computer science and working in the field of computer
              science and game design especially in Japan.

          I have a pet Holland mini lop mix breed rabbit named Peter.
          Furthermore, one of the worst times he got into trouble was when I had
          him out of my room wandering around the house. The next thing he did
          was he chewed up all of the cords in one of the areas of the house and
          he got into a lot of trouble for it and somehow didn't die from doing
          it.
