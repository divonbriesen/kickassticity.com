# Student Introduction Instructions

## Overview

Each student must create a personal introduction entry in the shared class document. Follow these formatting guidelines exactly to ensure consistency and proper organization.

## Required Format

### 1. Header Format

- **Start with Heading 2**: Use `## Last, First` format
- **Example**: `## Smith, John` (not `## John Smith`)
- **Include nickname if desired**: `## Smith, John "Johnny"`

### 2. Disclaimer Statement

Include this acknowledgment statement immediately after your header:

```
I understand that what I put here is publicly available on the web and I won't put anything here I don't want the public to see. - [Your Initials] [Date]
```

### 3. Name and Animal Format

Include your full name and chosen animal identifier:

```
[First Name] "[Nickname]" [Last Name] || [Adjective] [Animal]
```

**Example**: `John "Johnny" Smith || Jolly Shark`

### 4. Photo

Include one appropriate photo with a caption describing when/where it was taken.

### 5. Personal Statement

Write a brief paragraph (3-5 sentences) introducing yourself, your interests, and goals.

### 6. Required Sections

Use bullet points (●) for each section:

**● Personal Background:** Brief description of where you're from, family, interests, hobbies, living situation.

**● I'd Also Like to Share:** (Optional) Additional information you want classmates to know.

### 7. Course Expectations Section

## Formatting Requirements

### DO:

- Use proper bullet point formatting (● for main points, ○ for sub-points)
- Keep sections clearly separated
- Use consistent formatting throughout
- Place entry in correct alphabetical order by LAST NAME
- Proofread for spelling and grammar

### DON'T:

- Edit the Table of Contents (it updates automatically - but when first making your entry, right-click it and choose Update....)
- Use inconsistent bullet point styles
- Include overly personal or inappropriate content
- Forget the disclaimer statement
- Place entry in wrong alphabetical position

## Alphabetical Placement

Your entry must be placed in the correct alphabetical position based on your **LAST NAME**:

- A names (Adams, Anderson, etc.) go first
- Z names (Zhang, Zimmerman, etc.) go last
- Use last name only for alphabetization, regardless of hyphens or multiple last names

## Technical Notes

- The document auto-saves
- Do not edit content outside your own entry
- If you make a mistake, simply edit your own section
- Ask for help if you have formatting questions
